Battletech,20.9.2025,Turnbased tactics,Linux,2018,Steam,"I hate reviews that point out that a game has so much wasted potential, and Battletech to my annoyance has that wasted potential. The game has two issues: technical and design.\n\nThe technical problems begin with the Atlas in the room, namely the performance. I don't understand how this game can perform so bad considering it doesn't look that good, doesn't simulate bullet trajectories (ie. missiles clip through mountainsides and still hit their target), and in general only uses the visuals as an abstraction to an under the hood die roll. I would excuse the erratic frame drops on a high end PC if the reason was an intricate physics simulation that accurately calculates bullet drop over a kilometer of range with a changing terrain, but the game doesn't do anything of the kind. The performance also extends to the UI - simply okaying a OK checkbox in the FIFA team management part of the game (that is, outside combat), may take 3 seconds. Even if everything else about the game was perfect, these performance issues would cost the game's score to drop from 10 to 7.\n\nNext are the design problems: The singleplayer campaign features missions where the player is constantly facing overwhelming odds, usually 1 player lance facing 2-4 enemy lances. This would be acceptable if the game allowed me to play smart: Allow me to analyze the OPFOR and the map before I accept a contract, allow me to choose where on the map I deploy my lance, give me the tools to play smart (aerial recon, beagle probes, artillery...), but it doesn't. In addition, the enemy frequently gets reinforcements which appear on the map out of thin air, often to a spot you have already scouted and where you already have a mech holding a nice, defensive position. This is exactly the same behavior that the problematic X-Com remake had. The only way to successfully complete the missions is to exploit the AI by forcing them to engage your mechs one at a time, which I don't want to do as it makes me feel like I'm playing a boardgame where I minmax with the rules instead of roleplaying a commander of a mech lance.\n\nAfter all the negativity, there is one saving grace for Battletech: mods. Especially Battletech Advanced 3062 adds a lot of needed complexity to the game, but even it struggles to manage with the game's massive technical and design problems. If the core game had a solid foundation on which to build on, the mods would make Battletech one of the best games I've played. Unfortunately, it doesn't.\n\nBuy at a heavy discount only if you have an absurdly powerful PC with at least 32 GB of RAM."
Starcom: Unknown Space,18.8.2025,Space exploration,Linux,2024,GOG,"An extremely well made space game that combines Star Trek with Star Control. The first 12 hours were 10/10, but after that I began to tire of the same weapons, ships, and recycled events. Considering the game took me 26 hours to complete with plenty of side content undone, this means there was quite a lot of uninteresting exploration after the initial greatness. However, every now and then a new event or a discovery refreshed the otherwise mundane flying through empty space. I also felt there were too many alien races, and instead of adding new ones, I would have preferred going deeper with a smaller number.\n\nI felt the ship building was fun, but some resources were a bit too tight to find and upgrading my ship was a bit slow. But regardless of that, I never felt the game was hard and challenge was good, until in the late game I felt I was way too powerful even though I hadn't even upgraded everything to max.\n\nThe story was good but not great, writing all right, graphics good, and music suitable. Recommended at full price."
Another Crab's Treasure,2.8.2025,Souls,Linux,2024,Steam,"Executes its idea in a delightfully charming way. I was not a huge fan of the graphical style, but objectively I think it's good. This is a solid souls-like that feels mostly good to play and has an enjoyable sense of humor. Exploring the areas and seeing how the underwater life uses scrap is probably the game's best part.\n\nThe combat feels good in regards to striking and blocking, and parrying (once learned) is mostly solid with an asterisk. The special abilities done with right trigger all are good and enjoyable to use. The grappling hook, on the other hand, lacks polish - don't expect Sekiro.\n\nThe game has three major problems:\n\n1) The movement is, by design, clumsy, and you can't really maneuver around enemies like you can in more faster-paced souls-likes. This also makes the games extensive platforming segments a chore to play, and often boss fights can feel like a waiting game especially with later bosses that keep running away or stall for time.\n\n2) The bosses follow the current souls-like school of thought where enemies use \'delayed loaded spring attacks\' that delay, then strike like a loaded spring faster than the human reaction time. The only way to avoid such an attack is to memorize it. Combined with point 1), this makes the boss fights an exercise in memorization, which I hate.\n\n3) Many of the skills that are unlocked through the snail would work better as default movements, especially parry, riposte, and critical attack. I wondered for a long time what the point of capsizing enemies is if I can barely land 1 or 2 normal hits on them, only to later discover I was supposed to unlock the critical strike ability. Much like Lies of P, it makes little sense to me to lock these behind upgrades. Why do modern games insist on unlockables?\n\nOther minor nitpicks about the combat are:\n\nOften parrying successfully must NOT be followed by a riposte, as parrying does not stagger all enemies and attacks. This is especially true for bosses where parrying is a trap that punishes the player unless you know to parry only the final attack in a 5 attack chain, as the fifth attack is the only one where the enemy cannot strike back at you. This is a shame as the parrying, once learned, is quite good and easy to use as it is (finally!) a return to the Dark Souls 1 system where there are no windup frames.\n\nThe final boss has a move where he enters his shell that reflects the attack back to the player, and he can do this in middle of a player's attack animation, which makes taking damage in this fight essentially random.\n\nThe targeting, without lock on, often directs the player to an enemy. If I play without a lock on, I want my attacks to be unguided. This frequently leads me to striking enemies I did not want to strike at.\n\nThe input queueing behaves differently for different animation states, and often I tap a button (such as healing), and wonder why my crab stands still without healing. Sometimes the healing is queued properly and executes the moment my previous animation completes. This also happens frequently with charge attack not beginning to charge even though my attack button is pressed down.\n\nMany attacks that can be dodged still deal damage to the player after dodging them. The final boss is the worst offender in this where the side-sweeping attacks, if dodged sideways, don't deal damage at the beginning of the dodge, but do so when the iframes end.\n\nBeyond that, I recommend Crab Souls as a solid souls-like. It's clearly a labor of love and, while it has its share of bugs, looks complete without any obviously unfinished areas or bossfights."
Mouthwashing,29.5.2025,Horror,Linux,2024,Steam,"I don't even know. Play it I guess."
Grunn,28.5.2025,Horror,Linux,2024,Steam,"A simple horror game that has a 30~ minute playable sequence that the player repeats over and over again. The only way to advance in this game is to know more, as nothing persists between runs. The mystery and the progression by knowledge was fun, similar to Outer Wilds, but ultimately I hoped the story did more. Worth getting at full price if you want a fun world to explore with around 8 hours of gameplay."
Tormented Souls,27.2.2025,Horror,Windows,2021,GOG,"A good looking old school horror game that plays with the equal jank to the older Silent Hill games. I quit after a few hours due to the save system. Saves are earned by finding items that allow saving, and they are rare. You can't quit the game without saving, and you cannot earn more save points without proceeding in the game. Dying is easy with the old school bad camera angles, and death means easily losing an hour of progress. Story felt clumsily written, and in the first few hours didn't give me any reason to feel afraid at anything the game showed me. Goes in the big bucket of games that look good but have little else going for them."
Arx Fatalis,28.5.2025,CRPG,Windows,2002,GOG,"I played with the Arx Libertatis engine, which fixes many bugs, but I still had my share of them. This is a very unique gem that I enjoyed, even though the slow movement speed and jank often frustrated me. There's a lot of fun mechanics like cooking food that bring a smile to my face. The spell system, while cool, suffers from the usual pitfalls for gesture systems, namely the gestures not being recognized. At least the game doesn't punish you too hard for messing them up. The world was fascinating, and I hoped the game would have explored it more. Overall, this was a fun game that could have been so much more."
Not For Broadcast,29.1.2025,Motion propaganda simulator,Windows,2022,GOG,"The basic idea of this game is ingenious. Being the guy who decides which camera is shown and which adverts to run is a great system, and that was by far the game's highpoint. Unfortunately, the bad stuff made that part weaker than it could be.\n\nThe game is filled with little events that increase the difficulty, which all build on the idea that you have to focus on several things at the same time: What the people on the broadcast say (so you can predict what to do in a few seconds), managing the interference gauge, censoring bleeps, not showing photobombers, and ultimately, not pressing the electrified buttons. Of these, I enjoyed only the censoring aspects. The interference gauge is simply a weird mechanic that shouldn't be there, and the electrified buttons made me reload a save twice before I understood how the game mechanic works. Then it made me load a save third time as I kept pressing the electrified buttons on the same second the buttons got electrified.\n\nI didn't initially realize the electrifation is simply a roundabout way of preventing me from picking the most obvious camera angle. As soon as I realized the game is simply doing this, it became a weird 4D chess game where I had to ask myself: If I was the game developer, how would I make choosing camera angles as difficult as possible? As soon as I thought of that, I found the angles to use. An awful mechanic.\n\nI didn't get the story, as I simply lacked the ability to focus on the context or comprehending what people are saying while focusing on the production aspects. Luckily the game gives you a replay feature after the broadcast, although I found that tiresome.\n\nThis is a weird game. Get it on sale."
Dome Keeper,29.1.2025,Roguelite tower defense,Windows,2022,GOG,"Fun little game that combines mining for resources and defending against attacks against your base on the surface. The mining aspects got tiring soon, and I would have wanted the drillbert run to be default, even for the guild assignment missions. The tower defense aspect is sometimes fun, sometimes annoying, and is largely dependent on which dome you use or what the RNG gives you.\n\nThis goes on that list of roguelites where the unlockables seriously take away from the experience: by the time you start to unlock stuff, the game has become repetitive as you are just using the same equipment all the time. If the game started with the full pool of items already in the mix, it would work a lot better.\n\nBuy at a discount."
Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,19.1.2025,Horror,Windows,2015,Steam,"I don't quite get this game. It's seemingly procedurally generated hallways that keep going for 1000 rooms with next to nothing happening. If there was a story that continued from one room to another, or engaging gameplay in every room, I might have been lukewarm to this game, but after 250 rooms of pretty much nothing happening, I quit the game."
Amnesia: Bunker,19.1.2025,Horror,Windows,2023,GOG,"A horror game where the horror aspects turn to chores the moment the monster kills you for the first time and you realize you have to redo 15 minutes of gameplay. I feel like this goes in the pile of Frictonal Games that would be great if they would just stop adding monsters. The bunker as an environment is interesting enough without needing a creature to hunt us. Did not finish."
TOEM,1.1.2025,Cute exploration,Windows,2021,GOG,"A cutesy game about a journey to a mountain top where you stop on the way there to help people with random problems. The game is short, but even with that began to feel a bit tiring toward the end. If you liked A Short Hike, this is more of that feel, but with less interesting graphics."
Starsector,23.12.2024,Space exploration,Windows,2013,Other,"Even though this game is not yet finished, it has tons of fun things to do. I particularly liked exploration and the combat. The writing and story is good. I loved the setting. Recommended. The only problem I have with this game is its end game where it currently doesn't have enough things to do. Maybe when the game is properly finished?"
Shadow of Mordor,16.7.2017,3rd person action,Windows,2014,Steam,"I believe I played this game shortly after finishing Dark Souls 1 & 2, and boy was it difficult to get back into a game where you aren't acutely controlling all of your character's animations. The combat in this game was its worst part, which is a shame as I would love to play a game like this with Dark Souls combat. Movement felt restricted, and frequently my button presses resulted in a different action than I had intended. Even at the end of the game I never really felt like I controlled my character properly. It felt like I pressed buttons, and my character took those as recommendations. The nemesis system was cool. Story was eh."
Amnesia: Rebirth,1.4.2024,Horror,Windows,2020,Steam,"Compared to the original Amnesia, the biggest problem with this game was putting too much focus on the player character telling the story and reacting to every little thing. A silent protagonist is, I think, the preferable way to tell a horror story.\n\nThe alien world was visually interesting, but dull in terms of gameplay. I found myself losing interest as the puzzles got more involved, and the story didn't grip me like the original."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,1.10.2010,Horror,Windows,2010,Retail,"While occasionally suffering from forced jump scares that take control of the camera away, the rest of the game makes up for it. Good story, atmosphere, level design, and puzzles.",GOTY
Thief: The Dark Project,1.1.2011,Stealth,Windows,1998,Retail,"I had a demo of this game back in the day, but never really liked it as a child. When I got into it years later, I was immediately hooked.\n\nThief has its problems with the zombie levels, but that doesn't change the fact that the levels are BONKERS large with so much to find. Exploration, atmosphere, and story are Thief's strongest points, and its combat (or lack thereof on the canonical expert difficulty) is its weakest.\n\nThief is worth your time even today if you can get through the old school jank. You will find a lost jewel in this old title - trust me.",GOTY
Thief 2: The Metal Age,1.1.2011,Stealth,Windows,2000,Retail,"Someone else put it this way: Imagine you played Thief 1 and wrote a letter to the developers pointing out all the things that were off with the first game. Now imagine the devs got that letter and took it to the heart.\n\nWelcome to Thief 2.\n\nZombies are gone, and we're mostly dealing with urban environments with humans (and a few automatons). The levels are more difficult, more detailed, and some (but not all) of the quirks of the engine have been fixed. The story is even better than the first game.\n\nAgain, if you can survive old school jank, Thief 2 is worth your time.",GOTY
Frostpunk,1.4.2023, City building survival,Windows,2018,Steam,"Frostpunk is one of the most intense experiences I've ever had. The soundtrack is a masterpiece. The story, writing, and worldbuilding are all top-notch.\n\nYes, Frostpunk is a -very- good game.",GOTY
The Forgotten City,14.12.2024,Mystery,Windows,2021,GOG,"This game made me grin like an idiot for a good hour at a certain point. The game is almost flawless. The mystery is perfectly paced, answers all the questions, and in a compact time discusses both philosophy and morality in such an organic way that it often felt the game's dialogue choices were exact things I -would- say in that situation.\n\nThe game goes on the shared first place for the best mystery game along with Outer Wilds and Return of Obra Dinn. As is usual for this type of games, don't look up anything before playing the game.",GOTY
Blasphemous,28.11.2024,2D souls-like,Windows,2019,GOG,"Couldn't quite get into this. It's a slowish 2D souls-like metroidvania in style of Salt & Sanctuary. If you liked that, you'll like this."
Quest for Glory 4,12.11.2024,Point & Click adventure,Windows,1993,GOG,"A contender for the best Quest for Glory game with the first one. Requires fan patches due to game's incredibly troubled release. Voice acting was decent, graphics good, puzzles mostly fun, and story great."
The Solus Project,4.11.2024,Exploration survival,Windows,2016,GOG,"Tried this when someone recommended it as being similar to Outer Wilds, but I don't quite see the resemblance. The game is probably fine to those who want to collect a bunch of collectibles and slowly explore somewhat repetitive levels, but I found myself getting bored within the first 6 or so hours."
Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,11.8.2024,RPG,Windows,2012,GOG,"A pretty old-school RPG that plays similarly to MMORPGs with shopping lists of quests. I didn't quite understand the combat or the tactics you're supposed to use, unless tactics refers to abusing the AI and pulling off one enemy at a time. A bit too old-fashioned for my liking as someone who isn't too into role-playing games focusing on combat."
Ghost 1.0,29.7.2024,Platformer,Windows,2018,GOG,"From the same guy who did Unepic. This game shares the same type of humor, but is perhaps more mature about it. The gameplay is solid, but the levels felt pretty lifeless. I later discovered they were generated procedurally during development, and it shows. I liked the story and characters, but hoped the gameplay was deeper."
Return of Obra Dinn,1.7.2024,mystery,Windows,2018,GOG,"One of the best games I've ever played. Go play it now. Don't look up anything about this game - trust me.",GOTY
Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War,28.6.2024,RTS,Windows,2004,GOG,"The missions tend to be entirely linear with no challenge, and usually the best thing to do is turtle back home and build a massive blob, then attack move across the map. Only the last couple of missions are more interesting with an open map and an active AI, but unfortunately the AI is too simple to make the campaign that fun. I like the design of command points and being forced to move out to the map to get more resources, and to hold the strategic sites. This counters turtling gameplay. Unfortunately the lack of challenging AI and linear missions don't quite utilize this mechanic."
The Planet Crafter,6.6.2024,Sandbox survival,Windows,2024,GOG,"A beautiful survival basebuilding game where the planet slowly terraforms right before the player's eyes. The way the map opens up is almost like a metroidvania, and that was definitely the game's strongest point. The game worked well with minimal bugs, I liked the setting, and overall have little to complain about this game. I lost interest around the time I got insects to my world, as the game was mostly just waiting at that point."
Sunless Sea,22.4.2024,Survival exploration,Windows,2015,GOG,"This is a weird one. I love the atmosphere and worldbuilding, yet the gameplay itself is more like a puzzle where the player has to find the optimal way to do things. The early game features entirely too much grinding to be fun, and the combat is too janky to ever become fun."
Suzerain,31.3.2024,Visual novel,Windows,2020,GOG,"Up there as one of the best visual novels I've played, and definitely the one with the most realistic characters. I really cared for my president."
Hardspace: Shipbreakers,16.3.2024,Dad game,Windows,2022,GOG,"The game is strangely satisfying. First you start a shift and see a huge spaceliner waiting for disassembling, and you take a few looks at the ship from all angles while wondering where you're even supposed to begin. Some 2-3 hours later, when you sort the final airlock connector to the right slot and the entire ship has been 99% correctly recycled, that strange feeling of satisfaction is a rare thing to get in games these days. Unfortunately the story was dreadful and didn't add anything to the game. I don't think I found a single bug."
A Short Hike,15.3.2024,Chill adventure,Windows,2019,GOG,"An incredibly positive \'cute game\' about reaching the top of a mountain. This is 2-3 hours of absolute fun."
Hand of Fate 2,18.2.2024,Card game RPG combat,Windows,2017,GOG,"I don't like card games, but I liked Hand of Fate 2. My main issue with the game is the deck building: To survive, you have to prioritize non-combat items (things that modify random die rolls for one) and have to skip combat items. The combat itself is painfully easy and excruciatingly slow. My simple improvement for the game would be to separate non-combat items to their separate deck so the player could have what limited fun can be found in the bad \'Shadow of Mordor\' type combat, if at least so it can be over faster.\n\nGreat atmosphere and characters.\n\nThe campaigns were hit and miss, but I think I enjoyed over half of them."
Grime,26.1.2024,Metroidvania souls-like,Windows,2021,GOG,"This is a solid 2D metroidvania souls-like that has a really strong early game, but becomes more awkward toward the end. I enjoyed the exploration elements, but the late game boss fights featured too much waiting for the boss to do a 20 hit combo before they were vulnerable for a single hit. Great soundtrack."
Canine,1.12.2024,First person horror,Windows,2023,GOG,"A charming indie first person horror game about finding your lost dog. Some parts were slow, but due to the shortness of the game, I didn't particularly mind."
The Excavation of Hob's Barrow,27.12.2023,Point & click,Windows,2022,GOG,"For being produced by Wadjet Eye, this game felt strangely dated. The puzzles involved the worst of the 90s point & click logic, and the overall polish was lacking compared to the better titles out there. The story became strange toward the end. Overall, this would have been a great release 15 years ago, but in 2024 only stands out as average."
Strangeland,23.12.2023,Point & click,Windows,2021,GOG,"The game is mostly exploration of psychological themes and dream-like images. The puzzles were mostly enjoyable, and the story, if it can be called that, was a trip worth having."
Vaporum,23.12.2023,CRPG,Windows,2017,GOG,"This game wasn't for me. The game runs similar to Legend of Grimrock, but has a steampunk aesthetic. If you liked Grimrock, you'll like this."
Whispers of a Machine,23.12.2023,Point & click,Windows,2019,GOG,"A pretty solid point & click adventure that lost my interest toward the end."
Dead Cells,10.12.2023,2D Souls-like,Windows,2018,GOG,"This game involves very fast platforming and combat, but due to its procedurally generated levels, I couldn't find myself really enjoying exploring them. The game runs extremely well and the combat is satisfying."
Darkwood,11.11.2023,Survival horror,Windows,2017,GOG,"A bizarre top-down survival game involving one of the weirdest stories I've encountered in a while. The game is definitely not for everyone, but it was an immediate hit for me. I loved the sense of danger everywhere I went, and the nights came with some of the most intense tension I've seen since Subnautica. Try it and see if it's for you.",GOTY
GRIS,11.11.2023,Platformer,Windows,2018,GOG,"The game is more of a walking simulator, and its platforming elements didn't even really need to be there. This is more of a multimedia experience than a game, or that's how I would have preferred to play this."
Ken Follett's The Pillars of Earth,11.11.2023,Point & click,Windows,2017,GOG,"An extremely well-written point & click adventure with a realistic setting. Great graphics, voice acting, and puzzles. A must play."
The Way,11.11.2023,Platformer,Windows,2016,GOG,"This game is full of sequences that require the player to do steps A, B, C, and D in a highly specific order, and offers no shortcuts for doing them. Backtracking is mandatory, most puzzles are trial and error, and dying is frequent. Shame, as the graphics looked good."
Dredge,25.10.2023,Fishing horror,Windows,2023,GOG,"Amazing atmosphere, good gameplay, but toward the end I found myself tiring of the fishing mechanics. Great soundtrack, a good visual aesthetic, and good use of making the player fear what they don't understand. Recommended.",GOTY,
No Man's Sky,1.6.2023,Sandbox,Windows,2016,GOG,"This is a strange game. It felt like they had created a beautiful universe filled with stuff, but instead of letting the player immerse themselves in exploring it and feeling like they were the first to ever set foot on a planet, they flooded the game with weird mechanics that constantly intruded with the experience. It was as though they did everything in their power to remove any sense of discovery. Definitely not for me."
Deus Ex: Mankind Divided,31.3.2023,FPS,Windows,2016,GOG,"The game felt pretty linear with lots of bugs and too spammy UI. I gave up after maybe 5 hours."
Prey (2017),5.3.2023,FPS RPG,Windows,2017,GOG,"I would likely enjoy Prey if it didn't focus so much on combat. The space station felt mysterious, and I wanted to see what was waiting behind each locked door, but I couldn't quite put myself in the mood when I constantly had to fight monsters. I played perhaps 10 hours before losing interest."
Prey (2006),1.1.2008,FPS,Windows,2006,Retail,"A fun and well-produced traditional first person shooter that makes good use of all three dimensions. The story is suitable for a game involving lots of explosions."
"Biing!: Sex, Intrigue and Scalpels",17.2.2023,Adult,DOSBox,1995,GOG,"This was free on GOG. Yeah."
Tyranny,6.2.2023,RPG,Windows,2016,GOG,"The world and characters seemed well written, yet I found myself disliking the actual gameplay, including the combat."
Factorio,17.12.2022,Factory,Windows,2020,GOG,"Factory must grow. Still the best factory game out there."
Kingdom Come: Deliverance,6.12.2022,RPG,Windows,2018,GOG,"Peasant simulator 2018. The game has fun characters, story, and world, but the combat and general controls felt clumsy. The combat was barely approachable in 1v1 duels, but most of the game's frequent fights are ganks. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish the game due to losing interest in the combat elements."
UBOAT,4.8.2024,Submarine sim,Windows,2024,Steam,"A submarine simulator with focus on crew management. Ironically, I found the crew elements the worst part of the game and sort of hoped for a mod to disable it entirely. The game plays mostly well, but suffers from bugs and lack of content. However, it's currently one of the best submarine simulations out there."
Lords of the Fallen,7.7.2024,Souls-like,Windows,2023,Steam,"A re-imagining of the older game with the same name, Lords of the Fallen is a good and solid souls-like after the various patches have fixed most of the issues. The \'two worlds\' mechanic is interesting, but sometimes is taken too far, especially in boss fights, which often require holding the umbral lamp to destroy parasites while also trying to avoid being hit. The boss fights are a mixed bag, but overall I enjoyed most of them."
Animal Well,23.6.2024,Metroidvania,Windows,2024,Steam,"One of the best metroidvanias I've played in a while. This game shows a story can be told without words. Play it now."
Aliens: Dark Descent,9.6.2024,Topdown tactics,Windows,2023,Steam,"This squad-based Aliens game has a really solid core, and the first two missions are almost flawless. My problems started with 3rd mission and continued to the end as the game had a tendency to take control away from me, move my squad through a door into an unexplored room, where I would be ambushed from all sides. I never understood why this was required at all - all the boss fights or ambushes would have been 100% satisfying if there were no cutscenes at all and the player remained fully in control.\n\nThe story started strong with the whole crashlanding + escape plan setup, but went deep into weird territory with alien-human hybrids, a religious cult worshipping xenos, and unlikely coincidences that somehow involved the commanding officer's daughter. The game would have been a flawless alien game if all the missions had been some repeats of the first two missions where the player slowly salvages equipment to repair the ship, as well as finds the personnel needed to do the repairs, and this leads to tension among the crew, which leads to character development.\n\nThe other huge problem is that the game gives the player a deadline for the escape from the planet, and forces the player to make tough calls such as not running a rescue mission that would delay your departure by 2 days. I made these calls, knowing I wanted to have some spare time in case there were surprises, only for the last mission of the game to have the biggest ludonarrative dissonance I've seen in a long time and jump to the last day of the timer even though I had almost a week left. This happens with everyone on the comms suddenly talking about the 'missiles being on the way' without the player having been told that apparently we somehow just wasted a week doing nothing.\n\nMaybe they'll release an expansion one day?"
The Long Dark,6.4.2024,Survival,Windows,2017,Steam,"This is a solid survival game, but after the first week I found myself asking: \'Yes, and?\' due to the game's lack of further things to do beyond the initial survival. The maps are a mixed bag with some being great, others being miserable.\n\nThis is one of the only games I can think of where I enjoyed inventory management."
Dying Light,12.11.2023,Zombie survival,Windows,2015,Steam,"Railroaded, hand-holdy, story-driven zombie game that constantly interrupts otherwise fine zombie-slaying action to tell the player what to do next. Not for me."
Lies of P,23.9.2023,Souls-like,Windows,2023,Steam,"An extremely well-produced Souls-like with a cool world, story, and combat mechanics. Unfortunately, the dodge / deflect timing is too tight for me, and the boss design is almost entirely favoring unreadable, unpredictable \'loaded spring\' attacks that require memorization instead of the traditional \'observe and understand\' approach of older Dark Souls titles."
Dave the Diver,9.6.2023,Fishing adventure,Windows,2023,Steam,"An absolutely delightful fishing adventure that takes inspiration from parody shows like Yakitate!! Japan. The game was great, but had its low points, namely the entire Sea People arc."
Outer Wilds,3.5.2023,Mystery,Windows,2020,Steam,"One of the best games I've ever played. Don't look up anything about this game - go play it blind. Do it now.",GOTY
Choo-Choo Charles,25.4.2023,Horror,Windows,2022,Steam,"A silly indie horror that looks and plays incredibly well for such a humble production. The game can be played in one or two evenings and feels satisfying all the way through. Occasionally scary, too."
INFRA,26.2.2023,Urban exploration,Windows,2016,Steam,"INFRA is an urban exploration game that involves going to the husks of abandoned infrastructure and photographing various faults and problems discovered within. I loved the first level, but as the game into sewers, caves, or underground, I lost interest. The apartment slum was the worst part of the game."
Iron Lung,5.12.2022,Horror / submarine sim,Windows,2022,Steam,"An extremely terrifying game that accomplish a lot with so little. This is a short game - play it if you don't mind a scary experience."
XCOM: Enemy Unknown,29.10.2022,Tactics,Windows,2012,GOG,"It was alright. Too boardgame-like for my liking. I couldn't play this and not compare it to the original, which I think was better in most ways except the jankiness. This game felt like a series of bad Hollywood action films where your invulnerable heroes save the day, and every mission is some near-miss-disaster where you always race against the lock. The game would be better if it had\n\n1) larger maps where you use a squad of 10-15 soldiers\n\n2) free aim + bullet trajectories\n\n3) more liberal use of explosives\n\n4) less importance on character levels, instead prioritizing equipment and tech\n\n5) all characters able to use all equipment\n\n6) no constant narration from the XO during mission. The game could let me observe the game and make my own decisions instead of constantly interrupting the game to tell me what to do. If I see a new alien on a mission, let me first lose a soldier to it before spoiling me the appropriate tactics for facing it."
Total War: Warhammer,1.10.2022,Strategy,Windows,2022,Steam,"I bought all Warhammer titles at the same time. This is probably the most fun one can have in the Total War series, even though the Shogun 2 probably still has the best designed gameplay. There are so many factions and legendary lords to try that the game is unlikely to get boring for the first 200 hours. Some gameplay issues and bugs and remain, but for a game of this size, they can be excused. The main problem with the game is the price as the full experience requires buying Warhammer 1, 2, and 3, to the total of 180 euros."
Elden Ring,1.4.2022,Souls,Windows,2022,Steam,"It was alright. I didn't like the open world as it the liberal use of fast travel quickly trivialized the feeling of journeying in the world, and the game wasn't designed for not using fast travel. Boss fights didn't feel enjoyable if you prefer playing a melee character, as most bosses used some kind of AOE that forced you to back away or had long combos with difficult-to-time delays and trick attacks. The world was beautiful, and there were a few good bosses, and Caelid was amazing. I'd rank this about the same as Dark Souls 2"
Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak,16.9.2021,RTS,Windows,2016,GOG,"Visually good-looking. Framerate is mostly good, with jittering happening quite often. There's also a lot of bugs, particularly with the user interface and controls. Sometimes the mouse gets stuck in the \'middle mouse button map drag\', and sometimes the controls freeze entirely. Loading times are strangely long for a game of this type.\n\nThere are too many cutscenes, most unskippable. To make matters worse, some cutscenes happen in \'real time\' while the game is playing, but the player's ability to control units is removed for the duration of the cutscene. This means it's possible to lose a whole army because a siege cruiser happened to bombard your troops during the cutscene. Sometimes this gets quite weird, as you can have a dramatic inter-mission cinematics ongoing while the battle progresses in the back and you hear \'Galsian air units inbound!\' over the narrator.\n\nThere's too much dialogue that tells the player what to do as opposed to letting the player make up their own decisions (\'we better not go in that choke point as there's a siege cruiser behind it\'). This is an RTS game where there's no need for strategy, as you're constantly told what to do. It makes me wonder who I'm actually playing as in this game: the general, or someone just pressing buttons for the general?\n\nGame encourages being thorough with salvaging for resources, but often the maps end before you have a chance to clean up every last resource, which comes biting you in the arse later since resources carry from one mission to another. The only way around this is to simply know the map will end once you hit a specific trigger.\n\nMany missions have artificial increase in difficulty (timers, rushing to defend an ally) as opposed to simply letting you complete the mission as your own pace. At the same time, some missions make you think you're in a hurry, but the design is in fact based on scripted triggers that use a poking the bear mechanic, where a huge attack on you happens when you complete a step. In these missions you are better off ignoring the mission objective until you've mined out the map. This makes for a weird mix where the game sort of want you to hurry while encouraging turtling.\n\nSome units are useless the entire game, some become useless when you unlock a better tech. LAVs are never useful, and the tanks become useless when you get railguns. Railguns in turn are trivialized when you get battlecruisers. Missile batteries were never useful as support cruisers have mobile anti air as well, and the baserunner, while cool, serves no purpose when the normal turrets do nothing against late game units and the anti-air is better done by support cruisers. I feel the gameplay took a turn for the worse when cruisers entered the field.\n\nIn regards to the game difficulty, siege cruisers are the only enemy unit that you need to care about in most missions. Luckily, the assistants warn you when on is sighted, and I the gameplay in having to prioritize taking them out immediately. Unfortunately, the AI players keep using poor units late into the game, which sort of trivializes a lot of the second half of the campaign.\n\nThe main carrier has a whole system of gameplay mechanics, but they don't really come into play that much.\n\nFormations, a dear feature of the original homeworld, are gone. Now ordering units to attack to a point clusters them together, which often causes unnecessary casualties due to enemy artillery.\n\nUnits forget their manually chosen targets if the target goes in the fog of war. This most often happens when using aircraft to order an airstrike on a specific unit, and when the aircraft gets in the region, after visuals have been lost, the aircraft picks a new target as opposed to following the earlier orders.\n\nThe story is fine, although the line-by-line writing is subpar. The story doesn't feel completed at the end. When the credits rolled, I was a bit surprised, as I expected one more mission."
Mount & Blade II Bannerlord,28.6.2021,Pirates!,Windows,2021,Steam,"Played after about a year in early access. Has pretty much all features of Warband, but more fleshed out. AI improvements on strategic level are very much welcome, although still not perfect. Combat mechanics could be improved to make formations make more sense. Faster world map movement speed would be welcome. The swinging of weapons and using ranged weapons is satisfying, as is riding. The city & castle management aspects could be more interesting."
Subnautica: Below Zero,28.6.2021,Survival,Windows,2021,Steam,"Less buggy than original, world is interesting, less scary than original, not sure if I liked the addiition of dialogue + NPC characters, segments on land were both annoying and refreshing, didn't complete due to missing a thing in early game and getting tired of the grind for resources"
Enter the Gungeon,30.6.2021,Roguelike,Windows,2016,GOG,"Plays well, fun gameplay, challenging, rewards learning, lots of content. Soundtrack wasn't much to my liking. Doesn't get repetitive for at least the first 100 playthroughs."
Witcher 3,11.6.2021,RPG,Windows,2015,GOG,"Writing, visuals, story, and characters are great, but gameplay gets numb. The part with the baron is great, but after the game gets pretty boring, especially in Skellige. Did not finish at about 50 hours in the game."
The Journey Down,20.2.2021,point & click,Windows,2017,GOG,"Not quite wadjet eye quality, but it's a good game. Chapter 3 has weak pacing and the story is mostly wrapped up in a hurry. The game is about getting to a fabled location, and when you get there, it's simply narrated in a cutscene that spans several months instead of giving you extensive gameplay there. I'd say that was the biggest letdown of the game. Music is great. Voice acting is ok."
Littlewood,4.2.2021,Harvestmoon,Windows,2019,GOG,"Fun enough, cute as hell, too simple in gameplay to remain interesting very long. Soundtrack could be better."
Streets of Rogue,19.11.2020,Roguelike,Windows,2019,GOG,"Fun roguelike that is clearly a work of love. Okay soundtrack, lots of interconnectivity, not too difficult, perhaps on the shorter side, although this is compensated by the vast amount of unlockables."
Katana Zero,20.10.2020,2D action,Windows,2019,GOG,"Good art, atmosphere, music, story, writing, well-executed gameplay that doesn't necessarily stay engaging to the end."
Crosscode,13.9.2020,RPG,Windows,2018,GOG,"Excellent. Likable characters, story and writing. Enjoyable combat, enjoyable puzzles. Good pacing. Good soundtrack. Good graphics. No bugs."
Sekiro,22.3.2020,Souls,Windows,2019,Steam,"Too difficult for my taste. The world, story and appeal didn't particularly appeal to me. Enemies that required items or produced instakill status effects were a poor design. Some bosses were amazing. I didn't find the vertical movement smooth or controllable enough and I assume we'll have to wait for one more title before From gets it right. Being locked to one fighting style + several bosses being limited in how you fight them didn't appeal to me, although I suppose if that's your thing you can expect really refined gameplay.\n\nNote from 2024: I did later warm up to the game. Great randomizer mod."
Doom,18.3.2020,Arena shooter,Windows,2016,Steam,"If arena shooters are your thing, this thing is probably as good as it gets. High production values all over, very minor bugs, good level design. However, I'm not into the genre and wasn't too into the game. Soundtrack sounded at times like dubstep due to how it synced with glory kills."
Stardew Valley,5.7.2019,Harvestmoon,Windows,2016,GOG,"Excellent. Cute story, perfect graphics, engaging storylines. Gameplay gets repetitive around the second year. Didn't see a single bug.",GOTY
Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,4.6.2019,Psychological action,Windows,2017,GOG,"Puzzles get dull, combat with multiple enemies is too hard due to target lock, visuals and storytelling are amazing, fantastic atmosphere"
Starcraft 2,30.5.2019,RTS,Windows,2015,Other,"Ignore the story and it's a pretty good RTS. Terran campaign has too many missions with timed rush objectives and is too hard, Zerg is a bit easy and Protoss is dull. The epilogue campaign is awful. Ignore the story as it feels like a Warcraft story and seems to have no relation to SC1 story. I'm a bit eh on this as I don't care about multiplayer."
Nier Automata,18.4.2019,Hack & slash,Windows,2017,Steam,"Excellent atmosphere and OST, suffers from being Japanese: Anime plot, game mechanics simply because games traditionally have those mechanics, repetitive gameplay, weird abrahamic references only because western audiences will SURELY get something out of them. All routes get dull towards the end and are refreshing at the beginning. Last route should have simply been a film without gameplay."
Accounting,11.4.2019,VR,Windows,2016,Steam,"Ok, not as good as Stanley Parable"
La-mulana 2,21.4.2019,Metroidvania,Windows,2018,GOG,"There are game breaking softlock bugs that require reloading earlier saves. The movement, a direct copy paste from the first game, is glitchy, and several items often cause you to end up out of bounds. Grail points occasionally don't work, and areas don't load on screen transitions. There are a few development oversights in puzzle design which can produce an unwinnable state, although the developers are still working on getting those fixes.\n\nWhat happened? The first game was incredible, almost bug-free on release in 2005. This game felt like it was made by a different studio, based on the amount of issues I encountered during my playthrough.\n\nIgnoring the bugs, there are larger problems: It felt like the game was designed with the assumption that most players enjoyed the sadistic difficulty of the La-mulana 1 bonus dungeon as the entire level design of this game is based on tricky, precise platforming that's hard with the game's controls.  There are enemise that knock you onto pits. There are spikes everywhere. As you play the game further, more and more and more enemies spawn, making progression through areas a hindrance. If the game played like Hollow Knight it would be fun. But it doesn't, and it's not. La-mulana controls like an obese sea turtle and the combat involves lots of RNG, bouncebacking and damage you won't avoid unless you're an absolute master in platformers.\n\nThe boss fight and mini bosses are a bit more challenging that the first game, and several bosses feature boss design I found annoying to deal with. We don't play these games for the combat mechanics or platforming - we play them for the puzzles.\n\nWhich brings us to the strong point: Fans of the original game will like the puzzles in this one. Some puzzles are trickier, some not. There's a lot of cool new puzzle mechanics, and added NPCs and dialogue is much welcome.\n\nMusic wasn't as good as Mulana 1. Graphics are excellent. The game took me about 150 hours to finish with two riddles requiring me to look up a hint."
Shortest Trip to Earth,30.12.2019,Roguelike,Windows,2019,GOG,"FTL with more stuff, at times too difficult, enjoyable exploration and often unfair \'you died\' moments"
Saya no Uta,1.11.2019,Visual novel,Windows,2003,Other,"Excellent lovecraftian visual novel that would have been improved if the eroge scenes were implied as opposed to being shown in detail"
VA-11 Hall-A,1.10.2019,Visual novel,Windows,2016,GOG,"Very chilly and enjoyable visual novel with an interesting story"
Quest for Glory 2,20.1.2019,RPG point & click,DOS,1990,Other,"Same issues as QFG1 with poor performance and awkward movement. The world feels larger, but this is often artificial scale caused by the street system that's mostly annoying. Music wasn't great. Story was better than in QFG 1. The day system often lead to sleeping at the inn and then checking every point of interest in the game, only to find out nothing happened that day. Oftentimes, the magic user character type had weird solutions to puzzles considering how many spells could have been used to solve a puzzle."
Celeste,19.1.2019,Platformer,Windows,2018,itch.io,"Early game is dull, but later levels are marvelous and feature one of the best bossfights in any platformer game, ever. Good music, excellent writing and story."
Unavowed,1.1.2019,point & click,Windows,2017,GOG,"I finished Unavowed today. What a game - it may just have dethroned Technobabylon on the Wadjet Eye catalogue #1. I can't imagine this being a sole title and can only assume we'll see more of this masterpiece later.\n\nThe best parts of the game were the character dialogue and storyline, and the hardest decisions in the game weren't about the case ending moral dilemmas, but the metro character selection screens. All the characters worked and had their place, and now I want to play the game again only to see how different combinations of characters work together. My favorite was probably Mandana or KayKay.\n\nThe story pacing worked well and didn't feel hurried. The midway point with the three first cases solved produced a good final stretch to the final confontration, unwinding the open plot points.\n\nArt was excellent all over, although something in the main character's sprite seemed off to me, particularly the face. The portait looked good, though.\n\nSoundtrack was amazing with tunes of multiple different styles to keep them interesting.\n\nVoice acting was probably the best in a Wadjet Eye title yet.\n\nThere was some odd stuff with the puzzles, namely with inventory usage, such as using the passport to get past the bank security guard. I was stuck here for a while because I tried to either use Eli (inventory) on the passport or vice versa, not click the passport and then Eli (character). There were other points where this also happened. I'd assume that a puzzle solution of this type would work with any combination of the items or characters.\n\nOtherwise, the puzzles were on the easier side. I'd say they were still quite enjoyable.",GOTY
Quest for Glory 1,1.12.2018,RPG point & click,DOS,1989,Other,"Great mix or point & click, text parser and RPG. Enjoyable difficultly, puzzles, world and humor",GOTY
Ori and the Blind Forest,10.11.2018,Metroidvania platformer,Windows,2015,GOG,"Tight controls, good graphics, good level design, annoying boss fights and escape sequences"
Kathy Rain,7.10.2018,Point & Click,Windows,2016,GOG,"This is an adventure game rivaling Wadjet Eye quality in terms of graphics, voices (Wadjet Eye was involved in these, actually) and quality. Ultimately I get the feeling the author wanted to tell a story more than create a point & click game - there's a couple of neat puzzles, but generally they feel like roadblocks. The puzzles were my least favorite part of the game.\n\nThe writing is both good and bad. At times the game sets an emotional moment, but then the voice acting changes completely from a tearful scene into Kathy talking normally, which is kind of strange.\n\nBuy on sale if you enjoy linear, story-based adventure games with high production values."
Shadowrun: Hong Kong,15.7.2018,CRPG,Windows,2015,Steam,"Best of the three new Shadowrun games. Most compact story with best NPC interaction. Matrix rework was welcome, but maybe still a boring minigame that got tiresome after doing it twice. Best soundtrack."
Subnautica,10.7.2018,Survival,Windows,2018,Steam,"Taps into several fears that work for most people and delivers amazing atmosphere. The always-same world over having a procedural world was the right choice as the current world has been hand-tuned to deliver its beauty. The end game features never-ending bugs that sometimes may even require console hax to get past. The final task of the game is a fetch quest.\n\nStill, even with the game's faults, its amazing sense of discovery cannot be questioned.",GOTY
Shadowrun: Dragonfall,9.7.2018,CRPG,Windows,2014,Steam,"More Bioware style character plotlines were welcome, gameplay was more challenging, there should have been more customization in the stock characters as it's possible a stock character will end up having same utility skills as the main character"
Shadowrun Returns,24.6.2018,CRPG,Windows,2013,Steam,"Enjoyable combat, not too much of choices in terms of RPG, short, pretty compact without too much dead weight. Writing was alright. Music was alright."
Environmental Station Alpha,10.5.2018,Metroidvania,Windows,2015,Steam,"Solid Metroidvania, too much backtracking particularly early in the game without movement upgrades, some parts are sadistically difficult, the \'postgame\' riddles are built like the better puzzles in La-Mulana, and all in all the postgame stuff is pretty good apart from the platforming gauntlets"
Kholat,22.4.2018,Walking simulator,Windows,2015,GOG,"I assume a bunch of talented graphics artists got together and decided to create a game about a historical mystery. They got started on a visually impressive game, and at some point had a meeting where they realized they are making a video game and there's nothing to play in what they've created so far. They added monsters that didn't really do anything but occasionally require the player the press the sprint button for a couple of seconds or die and have to re-trek all the way to the monster location.\n\nThe story is segments of poetry that I didn't underestand.\n\nThe usage of the map and compass was great and I hoped the game was entirely like this with none of the monster nonsense. I only wish there was some sort of reward for finding the locations on the map instead of getting more writing that didn't matter at all.\n\nThe game was probably going to be a horror game, but there really wasn't anything to be afraid of: The monsters were shown early in the game and were mostly annoying. The only remotely scary aspect of the game were the sudden jumpscare soundtrack pieces that occasionally play for seemingly no reason, unless I missed something going on somewhere I was supposed to look."
Might and Magic 7: For Blood and Honor,17.3.2018,RPG,Windows,1999,Other,"They balanced some aspects of MM6, which made this game less fun to play. Dungeon design was more compressed and probably mostly better. Some story elements were more fun than MM6, but ultimately this game felt mostly like more of the same with less engaging gameplay. It takes quite a while to get your party going as so many good skills and spells are locked behind promotion quests, which means for a long time you need to abuse the enemy AI to kill some tougher enemies. MM6 had superior music, although the songs in this weren't bad. Annoyingly the music doesn't loop without reloading a save."
Warframe,1.12.2017,MMORPG,Windows,2013,Other,"Enjoyable fluid 3rd person movement and combat, engaging story, yet it's still a repetitive MMORPG. Could use more variety in level design and maps with wide open areas."
Doki Doki Literature Club,29.10.2017,Visual novel,Windows,2017,Steam,"The sentient-AI / self-aware characters gimmick is done well, although by this point so many games have gone that way that it doesn't deliver much surprises. I'm not a fan of Visual Novels that go for the whole dating sim waifu gimmicks, and as such I wasn't too into the game"
Hollow Knight,1.10.2017,Metroidvania,Windows,2017,GOG,"The best metroidvania I've ever played. The vastness of the game world surprised me several times, making me ask \'There's MORE?!\' over and over again. The controls were fine, yet I don't understand why the game recommends a controller since there's no analog input of any kind. I found keyboard superior after playing around 75% of the game with a controller. Sometimes pretty tricky, some bosses were boring and some \'access\' items should have been granted earlier.",GOTY
Total War Shogun 2 + Fall of the Samurai,1.8.2017,RTS,Windows,2011,Steam,"People say this is the best of the Total War games and I definitely wasn't disappointed. I would have wanted more variety in the units and battlefields, as particularly fort battles got repetitive."
Dishonored 2,1.7.2017,Thief,Windows,2016,Steam,"The game does not deviate much from what Dishonored 1 already established. I got the feeling the developers were afraid to change what had worked in the earlier game and stuck with that. Levels were smaller, but I'd say superior to the first game. Story wasn't as interesting. Unfortunately, massive amounts of crashing ultimately made this a worse game than the first one. The customer support mostly passed my crash reports around without answering my questions, nor did they actually seemingly care about if I offered them any more detailed crash details. Oh well."
Metro 2033 Redux,30.4.2017,FPS,Windows,2010,GOG,"A linear FPS with first person cutscenes and \'press E to progress in the game\' QTEs. Good atmosphere, functional progression. Horde attack sequences get pretty boring quickly, and sometimes running out of gas mask filters can require a replay of the entire chapter. Interesting moral compass system that's hidden from the player, but makes sense in regards to the story."
Betrayer,17.4.2017,FPS,Windows,2014,Steam,"Impressive atmosphere. Does a fine job in making the player learn the mechanics without explaining them, and to let the player decide what the game is about. The game stops giving new things to do early on and the game gets repetitive. There was one crash, and a few times I got stuck in geometry and had to reload. Writing and art are enjoyable enough. The weapon and item upgrades seemed out of place as they didn't matter except for the very end game items that offered significant bonuses."
Hyper Light Drifter,19.3.2017,Top down shooter,Windows,2016,GOG,"Amazing art, music, atmosphere and good gameplay. There were some issues with the combat, particularly stunlocks being an occasionao annoyment. The movement speed was a bit on the slower side before getting the dash upgrade. The intro cinematic is among the best I've ever seen and it took me a good while to understand that it was an allegory of the lead developer's own life and his maladies. After reading about the problems the lead developer had lived through, the entire game started making sense. Absolutely beautiful."
Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight,8.2.2017,Platformer,Windows,2016,Steam,"Improves on the previous Momodoras in all regards without changing the formula too much. Boss fights were on the easier side and I got the feeling the game was designed with challenge runs / speedruns in mind. Controlled the best out of all the games."
Tex Murphy Tesla Effect,5.2.2017,FMV,Windows,2014,Steam,"Occasionally filled with the typical Tex Murphy style awful puzzles, the game is a honest sequel to the original Tex games. Quality is generally improved, but there are a ton of tiny papercuts around the game, especially in the environment, that show they didn't have time to finalize the game. Pretty much entirely bug free, saving and loading works well. The whole score system seemed silly. There's really no reason to play the game on Gamer difficulty as there's a ton of pixel hunt puzzles of the modern variety where you need to spot the 3D model that is for some reason interactable when the rest of the scenery isn't. On Casual difficulty these hotpoints are marked and I'd say it's essential for completing the game. Acting's improved a bit, but it's still pretty tongue-in-cheek at times. Plot was typical Tex Murhpy where it gets too complicated and into James Bond territory towards the end. Romancing the transsexual results in the best ending ever."
Dark Souls 3,15.1.2017,Souls,Windows,2016,Steam,"Linear gameplay with no interconnecting areas was a letdown. Bosses were initially extremely difficult due to the transition from Souls 1 & 2 to Bloodborne style boss fights where fast maneuvering is essential. Enemies appeared to be much more intelligent than earlier, but their apparent lack of stamina and huge poise were kind of annoying. There were several gameplay bugs (teleporting enemies for one) that were problematic. Too many bosses were large humanoids with fire attacks, although the game's best boss, Pontiff Sulyvahn, was pretty interesting. Not many of the bosses were that memorable. A shout-out should go the game running relatively well on a lower end PC with low settings. Storyline and the atmosphere was better than Souls 2, but not as interesting as 1."
I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream,10.12.2016,Point & Click,DOS,1995,GOG,"I read the novel before getting into this game, to make sure I had a good foundation on what the game was trying to express. The original short story was, possibly, a take on the cold war and nuclear apocalypse, and the story uses this to paint a picture of hell.\n\nThe game's story was written in collaboration with the orginal author Harlan Ellison (who also provided the voice acting for the AI AM), and the writing is definitely the game's strongest part. Apparently the game's main focus was decided to be the character's back stories and psychological problems when the game's main writer David Sears asked Ellison why AM had selected the five people into its eternal torment. This question surprised Harrison and they then worked out the characters' backstories. The narrative is told in a sequence of 5 independent stories during which the characters come to terms with their own shortcomings. The final chapter is particularly interesting.\n\nThe programming was outsourced to an external company. I have no idea if the product was hurried into release, but the game is a buggy mess. There are glitchy graphics (Benny grows an extra arm during a cutscene), out-of-sequence puzzles being buggy (digging a grave, exiting the screen and returning to the screen removes the grave, but the interactable grave object still exists on the screen), save corruption happens (loading a game in Benny's chapter will cause the character to be invisible and interacting with anything will soft lock the game, although re-saving and loading again will fix this), there's at least one game locking puzzle that can be sequence skipped, object examine texts don't get updated (pick up a key, looking at the thing where the key was will still describe a key being on the table), sometimes cutscenes don't get triggered until the screen is entered a few times... It's a disaster.\n\nThe puzzles are somewhat challenging. Often times the solution to a puzzle is to go back and forth between trying something and then talking to a character to get their updated response to it. In Ellen's chapter you can only pick up a really obvious item near the chapter's end for some reason. The final chapter is extremely difficult, albeit interesting. It should be noted the game has some of the most surprising solutions to puzzles I've seen in a long, long time. Some of it is pretty gross. I'm amazed what they were allowed to leave in the game - who knows what the publisher forced them to remove.\n\nOriginally the author wasn't going to let the developers add in a \'happy\' ending as he didn't want the game to be winnable, but they had to later make some amendmends, supposedly because it would have been bad marketting to advertise a game one cannot win.\n\nMusic was pretty enjoyable. There was enough of it to offer some variety, although there could have been more. It's pretty traditional mid 90s MIDI if that's your thing.\n\nArtwork is mediocre. Animations have room for improvement while backgrounds look alright."
Castlevania,21.11.2016,Platformer,NES,1986,Emulator,"About as bad as primitive NES platformers get"
Super Metroid,20.11.2016,Metroidvania,SNES,1994,Emulator,"Overall, the game was damn good. I found myself rather bored in the last water area, mainly because it seemed to involve a lot of trick jumps to get items. It wasn't as bad as La-Mulana in showing you something you think you need to be able to solve, only to find out you solve that 5 minutes before the game ends. Instead most of the times the thing was achievable pretty soon and every area had parts that were clearly marked \'you need an item to get through here.\' I wasn't a fan of taking damage upon touching enemies, which is also what annoyed me in La-Mulana. The final boss had a weird attack that was seemingly unavoidable and killed you unless you had more than x health. I also didn't really understand what I was fighting there, but maybe if I had the game manual it would tell me\n\nThe progression was pretty fluid. Sometimes I had difficulties remembering what was where as the game doesn't really make any kind of notes. Suppose this was '94.\n\nI also had issues finding my way around as I got lost in the dungeon\n\nAt least the game didn't require you to run all the way to the top using the normal route at the end. That would have taken me 30 minutes.\n\nThe wall jumping was really neat. It was a bit sad how you didn't really need it after getting some items"
Momodora 3,25.9.2016,Platformer,Windows,2014,Steam,"While the previous game offered an illusion of freedom in choosing one's path, this game moves to a linear platformer. The game runs about the same as the second game, but is faster paced. Story does not really exist."
Momodora 2,24.9.2016,Platformer,Windows,2011,Free,"Some controls need improvement. Screen transitions are occasionally awful as enemies you don't see can hit you from outside the screen, or you can walk right into an enemy that's waiting at the screen transition. Difficulty is pretty good, requiring some tries but not too brutal. Enemies deal contact damage which can be annoying when attacking with the main weapon has such a short range. Pretty graphics, enjoyable music. No bugs. Character art reminds me of Touhou character portraits."
Elite Dangerous,1.1.2016,Space flight sim,Windows,2014,Other / Steam,"Really fun for flying around. Looks great. That's about it. It's euro truck in space where you don't have anything to do, and the argument for saying it's a multiplayer game only is valid when the P2P architecture eventually works with more than 2 players robustly."
The Samaritan Paradox,9.8.2016,Point & Click,Windows,2014,GOG,"For a game released in 2014 this title seems extremely dated. It might be that I'm used to more finalized adventure games (namely from Wadjet Eye) and haven't played any of the more basic Adventure Game Studio releases in a while.\n\nThe biggest downside of the game were the bugs. On two occasions I ended up having a bug that required me to reload and earlier save as I was in an unwinnable state. Once the game stopped rendering the graphics after a screen transition during a cutscene, leaving the game screen completely black until I restarted the game. The path-finding has a few quirks, and sometimes the wrong animations played when walking around.\n\nThe story of the game, like in most adventure games, is one of the better aspects. For many adventure titles the story is made too complex and the ending arrives hurried. In this case I felt the story might have been a bit on the simpler side and wasn't deep or long enough.\n\nThe characters were enjoyable enough, the protagonist being my favorite. Voice acting was passable, but a few characters had voices that were simply bad.\n\nPuzzles were refreshing difficult - even too much so. It's rare, but in this case I had to resort to a walkthrough to finish the game. A few of the puzzles required some knowledge that to my understanding cannot be found inside the game world. A die-hard adventure game player will probably solve all the puzzles with determination, though.\n\nMusic was good.\n"
Audioshield,27.8.2016,VR arcade,Windows,2016,Steam,"Audiosurf for VR. Tron style graphics work well, and the ability to use own music gives the game a lot of replayablity. The mechanics are a bit too simple, and mods are required to make it more interesting. Reasonable fun, but the price tag of 20 dollars is too high."
Cat Lady,24.7.2016,Psychological horror / adventure,Windows,2012,GOG,"This game is probably the one that best explores depression, with Depression Quest coming close second. Although the beginning of the game has some writing in it that was in my opinion lacking, overall the story is enjoyable after the beginning.\nThe graphics style was interesting. It should be noted that I didn't like the first game, Downfall especially due to its writing and graphics, but in this one both parts worked better.\nAudio has issues. The voice actors are passable, but unfortunately the recording equipment or mastering wasn't done with the highest quality in mind and occasionally even regular speech ends up breaking.\n\nPuzzles were mostly alright, although a few of them felt like they didn't belong there."
Her Story,11.8.2016,FMV,Windows,2015,GOG,"Goes for the whole Memento thing where the story is not told in a linear fashion. This allows the player to piece the puzzle together from the perspective of the detective. It was pretty fun to write down notes and slowly uncover the truth. I found it quite difficult to find the missing pieces in the storyline as I couldn't figure out the right keyword to use and the video listing only allowed 5 videos. I ended up going through the video files in the game folder manually. The game's only mechanic is the video archive system, stylished as it may be, but unfortunately it's not worth the game's price."
Technobabylon,11.6.2016,Point & Click,Windows,2015,GOG,"Lost the review when the forums went down. TL;DR: A contender for the best point & click game ever game, up there with the likes of the Longest Journey and Unavowed. Play it.",GOTY
Shardlight,11.3.2016,Point & Click,Windows,2016,GOG,"Lost the review when the forums went down. A solid point & click adventure that has its highs and lows, but overall is still a bargain for the price they're asking. Play it."
SOMA,1.8.2016,Walking simulator,Windows,2015,GOG,"Looks beautiful, writing is enjoyable, world fascinating. Monster segments were the worst portions - maybe installing that mod that disables mob aggression would have been a good idea. Those kinda broke the flow of the game. The big part that really sold the game to me was that there weren't any plot twists - everything is revealed in the beginning and the rest of the journey is simply exploring that topic."
Gray Matter,1.7.2016,Point & Click,Windows,2011,GOG,"Among the list of best systems for puzzles ever done in a video game, this game scores pretty high. The old \'use item y on x\' gimmick is still there, but the main showdown is the repertoire of magic tricks the protagonist can pull in order to con others. My biggest beef with this was that there wasn't enough of using magic tricks - surely they could have replaced some of the more traditional puzzles with a few additional sleights of hand.\n\nMost of the game is doing detective work of sorts and solving riddles, driving two plotlines forwards. The story itself is curious enough, although nothing too unique.\n\nIt baffles me how a point & click adventure game where the backgrounds are largely still image mattes can end up having a loading screen between each screen transition. Sometimes these loading times were up to 10 seconds on a reasonably powerful computer. Perhaps the game was designed so it worked on mobile platforms or something and always loaded the background images from disk or something along those lines. Anyway, whatever the reason was, the loading times were a definite problem.\n\nAnimations were occasionally dreadfully slow. Luckily, the game allows fast travelling using the map and skipping moving to the room's exit by double clicking.\n\nThe music in the game was alright and did its task well in the background. The primary letdown was that there wasn't enough music: With the exception of a couple cutscenes, the single, same music track with a pleasant piano melody is heard during the entire game. It got pretty repetitive towards the latter portions.\n\nVoice acting was alright. There was some room for improvement, though."
Last Express,1.6.2016,Point & Click,DOSBox,1997,GOG,"I have never played a game quite like this. Beyond its rough edges there exists a gem that is among the most immersive games I've played. The game produces an illusion of \'Choose Your Own Adventure\' due to the world acting without the player's presence. The player can be at the opposite end of the train, and events, even if scripted, are taking place, whether or not the player is there to see them.\n\nThe game is railroaded in the way that when bad ends happen the game offers a clock which the player can roll back to re-live past events. This happens until the player finally manages to solve all the puzzles in the right order and reach the true end.\n\nVoice acting is fantastic. I don't speak any of the foreign languages, but it definitely sounded natural when I heard Serbians talking among themselves, the upper class French chatting with the Germans and the Austrian doing her best to speak English.\n\nPuzzles are minimal, and very easy. The game is mostly about doing things in the right order and later correcting your mistakes.\n\nA must play.",GOTY

Dark Souls,1.1.2015,Souls,Windows,2009,Steam,"The game's ability to transform players is quite something. At the beginning of the journey the game slaps the player on their wrists, punishing the player for their every mistake. At several tiers of graduation examination the game slowly trains the player into understanding the game. After a specific boss fight the player will have leveled up more from that encounter than his character has. This game has, in my opinion, the best boss fight in the history of video gaming (O&S).\n\nThe level design and atmosphere are the game's strongest point. Everything connects logically and with style. There are no hub areas or nonsensical locations, but only the ruins of a fallen world now occupied by the undead and worse. What really separates this game from a lot of similar games is how it accomplishes its strongest point, the atmosphere.\n\nWith most games people generally play the game once, and if they really liked the game they will give it a second go. On a rare occasion people will keep playing the game over and over again. With Dark Souls I don't know a single person who has completed the game and left it there - they all come back for the game's massive replay value.\n\nThe game's biggest issues relate to its console origins: Framerate is defaulted to 30, and using mods to increase it to 60 will cause physics bugs. The online play is glitchy as best and lag has a constant presence.\n\nSeveral points in the game are too difficult unless you already have mastered a Souls game earlier. Many people will quit the game at these points for understandable reasons.",GOTY
