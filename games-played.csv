XCOM: Enemy Unknown,29.10.2022,Tactics,Windows,2012,GOG,"It was alright. Too boardgame-like for my liking. I couldn't play this and not compare it to the original, which I think was better in most ways except the jankiness. This game felt like a series of bad Hollywood action films where your invulnerable heroes save the day, and every mission is some near-miss-disaster where you always race against the lock. The game would be better if it had\n\n1) larger maps where you use a squad of 10-15 soldiers\n\n2) free aim + bullet trajectories\n\n3) more liberal use of explosives\n\n4) less importance on character levels, instead prioritizing equipment and tech\n\n5) all characters able to use all equipment\n\n6) no constant narration from the XO during mission. The game could let me observe the game and make my own decisions instead of constantly interrupting the game to tell me what to do. If I see a new alien on a mission, let me first lose a soldier to it before spoiling me the appropriate tactics for facing it."
Total War: Warhammer,1.10.2022,Strategy,Windows,2022,Steam,"I bought all Warhammer titles at the same time. This is probably the most fun one can have in the Total War series, even though the Shogun 2 probably still has the best designed gameplay. There are so many factions and legendary lords to try that the game is unlikely to get boring for the first 200 hours. Some gameplay issues and bugs and remain, but for a game of this size, they can be excused. The main problem with the game is the price as the full experience requires buying Warhammer 1, 2, and 3, to the total of 180 euros."
Elden Ring,1.4.2022,Souls,Windows,2022,Steam,"It was alright. I didn't like the open world as it the liberal use of fast travel quickly trivialized the feeling of journeying in the world, and the game wasn't designed for not using fast travel. Boss fights didn't feel enjoyable if you prefer playing a melee character, as most bosses used some kind of AOE that forced you to .back away or had long combos with difficult-to-time delays and trick attacks. The world was beautiful, and there were a few good bosses, and Caelid was amazing. I'd rank this about the same as Dark Souls 2"
Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak,16.9.2021,RTS,Windows,2016,GOG,"Visually good-looking. Framerate is mostly good, with jittering happening quite often. There's also a lot of bugs, particularly with the user interface and controls. Sometimes the mouse gets stuck in the \'middle mouse button map drag\', and sometimes the controls freeze entirely. Loading times are strangely long for a game of this type.\n\nThere are too many cutscenes, most unskippable. To make matters worse, some cutscenes happen in \'real time\' while the game is playing, but the player's ability to control units is removed for the duration of the cutscene. This means it's possible to lose a whole army because a siege cruiser happened to bombard your troops during the cutscene. Sometimes this gets quite weird, as you can have a dramatic inter-mission cinematics ongoing while the battle progresses in the back and you hear \'Galsian air units inbound!\' over the narrator.\n\nThere's too much dialogue that tells the player what to do as opposed to letting the player make up their own decisions (\'we better not go in that choke point as there's a siege cruiser behind it\'). This is an RTS game where there's no need for strategy, as you're constantly told what to do. It makes me wonder who I'm actually playing as in this game: the general, or someone just pressing buttons for the general?\n\nGame encourages being thorough with salvaging for resources, but often the maps end before you have a chance to clean up every last resource, which comes biting you in the arse later since resources carry from one mission to another. The only way around this is to simply know the map will end once you hit a specific trigger.\n\nMany missions have artificial increase in difficulty (timers, rushing to defend an ally) as opposed to simply letting you complete the mission as your own pace. At the same time, some missions make you think you're in a hurry, but the design is in fact based on scripted triggers that use a poking the bear mechanic, where a huge attack on you happens when you complete a step. In these missions you are better off ignoring the mission objective until you've mined out the map. This makes for a weird mix where the game sort of want you to hurry while encouraging turtling.\n\nSome units are useless the entire game, some become useless when you unlock a better tech. LAVs are never useful, and the tanks become useless when you get railguns. Railguns in turn are trivialized when you get battlecruisers. Missile batteries were never useful as support cruisers have mobile anti air as well, and the baserunner, while cool, serves no purpose when the normal turrets do nothing against late game units and the anti-air is better done by support cruisers. I feel the gameplay took a turn for the worse when cruisers entered the field.\n\nIn regards to the game difficulty, siege cruisers are the only enemy unit that you need to care about in most missions. Luckily, the assistants warn you when on is sighted, and I the gameplay in having to prioritize taking them out immediately. Unfortunately, the AI players keep using poor units late into the game, which sort of trivializes a lot of the second half of the campaign.\n\nThe main carrier has a whole system of gameplay mechanics, but they don't really come into play that much.\n\nFormations, a dear feature of the original homeworld, are gone. Now ordering units to attack to a point clusters them together, which often causes unnecessary casualties due to enemy artillery.\n\nUnits forget their manually chosen targets if the target goes in the fog of war. This most often happens when using aircraft to order an airstrike on a specific unit, and when the aircraft gets in the region, after visuals have been lost, the aircraft picks a new target as opposed to following the earlier orders.\n\nThe story is fine, although the line-by-line writing is subpar. The story doesn't feel completed at the end. When the credits rolled, I was a bit surprised, as I expected one more mission."
Mount & Blade II Bannerlord,28.6.2021,Pirates!,Windows,2021,Steam,"Played after about a year in early access. Has pretty much all features of Warband, but more fleshed out. AI improvements on strategic level are very much welcome, although still not perfect. Combat mechanics could be improved to make formations make more sense. Faster world map movement speed would be welcome. The swinging of weapons and using ranged weapons is satisfying, as is riding. The city & castle management aspects could be more interesting."
Subnautica: Below Zero,28.6.2021,Survival,Windows,2021,Steam,"Less buggy than original, world is interesting, less scary than original, not sure if I liked the addiition of dialogue + NPC characters, segments on land were both annoying and refreshing, didn't complete due to missing a thing in early game and getting tired of the grind for resources"
Enter the Gungeon,30.6.2021,Roguelike,Windows,2016,GOG,"Plays well, fun gameplay, challenging, rewards learning, lots of content. Soundtrack wasn't much to my liking. Doesn't get repetitive for at least the first 100 playthroughs."
Witcher 3,11.6.2021,RPG,Windows,2015,GOG,"Writing, visuals, story, and characters are great, but gameplay gets numb. The part with the baron is great, but after the game gets pretty boring, especially in Skellige. Did not finish at about 50 hours in the game."
The Journey Down,20.2.2021,point & click,Windows,2017,GOG,"Not quite wadjet eye quality, but it's a good game. Chapter 3 has weak pacing and the story is mostly "wrapped up" in a hurry. The game is about getting to a fabled location, and when you get there, it's simply narrated in a cutscene that spans several months instead of giving you extensive gameplay there. I'd say that was the biggest letdown of the game. Music is great. Voice acting is ok."
Littlewood,4.2.2021,Harvestmoon,Windows,2019,GOG,"Fun enough, cute as hell, too simple in gameplay to remain interesting very long. Soundtrack could be better."
Streets of Rogue,19.11.2020,Roguelike,Windows,2019,GOG,"Fun roguelike that is clearly a work of love. Okay soundtrack, lots of interconnectivity, not too difficult, perhaps on the shorter side, although this is compensated by the vast amount of unlockables."
Katana Zero,20.10.2020,2D action,Windows,2019,GOG,"Good art, atmosphere, music, story, writing, well-executed gameplay that doesn't necessarily stay engaging to the end."
Crosscode,13.9.2020,RPG,Windows,2018,GOG,"Excellent. Likable characters, story and writing. Enjoyable combat, enjoyable puzzles. Good pacing. Good soundtrack. Good graphics. No bugs."
Sekiro,22.3.2020,Souls,Windows,2019,Steam,"Too difficult for my taste. The world, story and appeal didn't particularly appeal to me. Enemies that required items or produced instakill status effects were a poor design. Some bosses were amazing. I didn't find the vertical movement smooth or controllable enough and I assume we'll have to wait for one more title before From gets it right. Being locked to one fighting style + several bosses being limited in how you fight them didn't appeal to me, although I suppose if that's your thing you can expect really refined gameplay."
Doom,18.3.2020,Arena shooter,Windows,2016,Steam,"If arena shooters are your thing, this thing is probably as good as it gets. High production values all over, very minor bugs, good level design. However, I'm not into the genre and wasn't too into the game. Soundtrack sounded at times like dubstep due to how it synced with glory kills."
Stardew Valley,5.7.2019,Harvestmoon,Windows,2016,GOG,"Excellent. Cute story, perfect graphics, engaging storylines. Gameplay gets repetitive around the second year. Didn't see a single bug."
Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,4.6.2019,Psychological action,Windows,2017,GOG,"Puzzles get dull, combat with multiple enemies is too hard due to target lock, visuals and storytelling are amazing, fantastic atmosphere"
Starcraft 2,30.5.2019,RTS,Windows,2015,Other,"Ignore the story and it's a pretty good RTS. Terran campaign has too many missions with timed rush objectives and is too hard, Zerg is a bit easy and Protoss is dull. The epilogue campaign is awful. Ignore the story as it feelsl ike a Warcraft story and seems to have no relation to SC1 story, and is written awfully. Music sounds like Hollywood filler soundtrack and is often placed with cringeworthy fake epicness."
Nier Automata,18.4.2019,Hack & slash,Windows,2017,Steam,"Excellent atmosphere and OST, suffers from being Japanese: Anime plot, game mechanics simply because games traditionally have those mechanics, repetitive gameplay, weird abrahamic references only because western audiences will SURELY get something out of them. All routes get dull towards the end and are refreshing at the beginning. Last route should have simply been a film without gameplay."
Accounting,11.4.2019,VR,Windows,2016,Steam,"Ok, not as good as Stanley Parable"
La-mulana 2,21.4.2019,Metroidvania,Windows,2018,GOG,"I did not enjoy the game.\n\nAfter a year, there are still game breaking softlock bugs that require reloading earlier saves. The movement, a direct copy paste from the first game, is glitchy, and several items often cause you to end up out of bounds. Grail points occasionally don't work, and areas don't load on screen transitions. There are a few development oversights in puzzle design which can produce an unwinnable state, although the developers are still working on getting those fixes.\n\nWhat happened? The first game was incredible, almost bug-free on release in 2005. This game felt like it was made by a different studio, based on the amount of issues I encountered during my playthrough.\n\nIgnoring the bugs, there are larger problems: It felt like the game was designed with the assumption that most players enjoyed the sadistic difficulty of the La-mulana 1 bonus dungeon as the entire level design of this game is based on tricky, precise platforming that's hard with the game's controls.  There are enemise that knock you onto pits. There are spikes everywhere. As you play the game further, more and more and more enemies spawn, making progression through areas a hindrance. If the game played like Hollow Knight it would be fun. But it doesn't, and it's not. La-mulana controls like an obese sea turtle and the combat involves lots of RNG, bouncebacking and damage you won't avoid unless you're an absolute master in platformers.\n\nThe boss fight and mini bosses are a bit more challenging that the first game, and several bosses feature boss design I found annoying to deal with. We don't play these games for the combat mechanics or platforming - we play them for the puzzles.\n\nWhich brings us to the strong point: Fans of the original game will like the puzzles in this one. Some puzzles are trickier, some not. There's a lot of cool new puzzle mechanics, and added NPCs and dialogue is much welcome.\n\nMusic wasn't as good as Mulana 1. Graphics are excellent. The game took me about 150 hours to finish with two riddles requiring me to look up a hint."
Shortest Trip to Earth,30.12.2019,Roguelike,Windows,2019,GOG,"FTL with more stuff, at times too difficult, enjoyable exploration and often unfair "you died" moments"
Saya no Uta,1.11.2019,Visual novel,Windows,2003,Other,"Excellent lovecraftian visual novel that would have been improved if the eroge scenes were implied as opposed to being shown in detail"
VA-11 Hall-A,1.10.2019,Visual novel,Windows,2016,GOG,"Very chilly and enjoyable visual novel with an interesting story"
Quest for Glory 2,20.1.2019,RPG point & click,DOS,1990,Other,"Same issues as QFG1 with poor performance and awkward movement. The world feels larger, but this is often artificial scale caused by the street system that's mostly annoying. Music wasn't great. Story was better than in QFG 1. The day system often lead to sleeping at the inn and then checking every point of interest in the game, only to find out nothing happened that day. Oftentimes, the magic user character type had weird solutions to puzzles considering how many spells could have been used to solve a puzzle."
Celeste,19.1.2019,Platformer,Windows,2018,itch.io,"Early game is dull, but later levels are marvelous and feature one of the best bossfights in any platformer game, ever. Good music, excellent writing and story."
Unavowed,1.1.2019,point & click,Windows,2017,GOG,"I finished Unavowed today. What a game - it may just have dethroned Technobabylon on the Wadjet Eye catalogue #1. I can't imagine this being a sole title and can only assume we'll see more of this masterpiece later.\n\nThe best parts of the game were the character dialogue and storyline, and the hardest decisions in the game weren't about the case ending moral dilemmas, but the metro character selection screens. All the characters worked and had their place, and now I want to play the game again only to see how different combinations of characters work together. My favorite was probably Mandana or KayKay.\n\nThe story pacing worked well and didn't feel hurried. The midway point with the three first cases solved produced a good final stretch to the final confontration, unwinding the open plot points.\n\nArt was excellent all over, although something in the main character's sprite seemed off to me, particularly the face. The portait looked good, though.\n\nSoundtrack was amazing with tunes of multiple different styles to keep them interesting.\n\nVoice acting was probably the best in a Wadjet Eye title yet.\n\nThere was some odd stuff with the puzzles, namely with inventory usage, such as using the passport to get past the bank security guard. I was stuck here for a while because I tried to either use Eli (inventory) on the passport or vice versa, not click the passport and then Eli (character). There were other points where this also happened. I'd assume that a puzzle solution of this type would work with any combination of the items or characters.\n\nOtherwise, the puzzles were on the easier side. I'd say they were still quite enjoyable.\n\nTechnical:\n\n* On the Wall Street mission, I couldn't talk to characters. Clicking them produced the character portrait for a brief moment before it vanished and no dialogue screen popped up. Restarting the game fixed this.\n* Mouse is not locked inside the window in windowed mode"
Quest for Glory 1,1.12.2018,RPG point & click,DOS,1989,Other,"Great mix or point & click, text parser and RPG. Enjoyable difficultly, puzzles, world and humor"
Ori and the Blind Forest,10.11.2018,Metroidvania platformer,Windows,2015,GOG,"Tight controls, good graphics, good level design, annoying boss fights and escape sequences"
Kathy Rain,7.10.2018,Point & Click,Windows,2016,GOG,"This is an adventure game rivaling Wadjet Eye quality in terms of graphics, voices (Wadjet Eye was involved in these, actually) and quality. Ultimately I get the feeling the author wanted to tell a story more than create a point & click game - there's a couple of neat puzzles, but generally they feel like roadblocks. The puzzles were my least favorite part of the game.\n\nThe writing is both good and bad. At times the game sets an emotional moment, but then the voice acting changes completely from a tearful scene into Kathy talking normally, which is kind of strange.\n\nBuy on sale if you enjoy linear, story-based adventure games with high production values."
Shadowrun: Hong Kong,15.7.2018,CRPG,Windows,2015,Steam,"Best of the three new Shadowrun games. Most compact story with best NPC interaction. Matrix rework was welcome, but maybe still a boring minigame that got tiresome after doing it twice. Best soundtrack."
Subnautica,10.7.2018,Survival,Windows,2018,Steam,"Taps into several fears that work for most people and delivers amazing atmosphere. The always-same world over having a procedural world was the right choice as the current world has been hand-tuned to deliver its beauty. The end game features never-ending bugs that sometimes may even require console hax to get past. The final task of the game is a fetch quest."
Shadowrun: Dragonfall,9.7.2018,CRPG,Windows,2014,Steam,"More Bioware style character plotlines were welcome, gameplay was more challenging, there should have been more customization in the stock characters as it's possible a stock character will end up having same utility skills as the main character"
Shadowrun Returns,24.6.2018,CRPG,Windows,2013,Steam,"Enjoyable combat, not too much of choices in terms of RPG, short, pretty compact without too much dead weight. Writing was alright. Music was alright."
Environmental Station Alpha,10.5.2018,Metroidvania,Windows,2015,Steam,"Solid Metroidvania, too much backtracking particularly early in the game without movement upgrades, some parts are sadistically difficult, the "postgame" riddles are built like the better puzzles in La-Mulana, and all in all the postgame stuff is pretty good apart from the platforming gauntlets"
Kholat,22.4.2018,Walking simulator,Windows,2015,GOG,"I assume a bunch of talented graphics artists got together and decided to create a game about a historical mystery. They got started on a visually impressive game, and at some point had a meeting where they realized they are making a video game and there's nothing to play in what they've created so far. They added monsters that didn't really do anything but occasionally require the player the press the sprint button for a couple of seconds or die and have to re-trek all the way to the monster location.\n\nThe story is segments of poetry that I didn't underestand.\n\nThe usage of the map and compass was great and I hoped the game was entirely like this with none of the monster nonsense. I only wish there was some sort of reward for finding the locations on the map instead of getting more writing that didn't matter at all.\n\nThe game was probably going to be a horror game, but there really wasn't anything to be afraid of: The monsters were shown early in the game and were mostly annoying. The only remotely scary aspect of the game were the sudden jumpscare soundtrack pieces that occasionally play for seemingly no reason, unless I missed something going on somewhere I was supposed to look."
Might and Magic 7: For Blood and Honor,17.3.2018,RPG,Windows,1999,Other,"They balanced some aspects of MM6, which made this game less fun to play. Dungeon design was more compressed and probably mostly better. Some story elements were more fun than MM6, but ultimately this game felt mostly like more of the same with less engaging gameplay. It takes quite a while to get your party going as so many good skills and spells are locked behind promotion quests, which means for a long time you need to abuse the enemy AI to kill some tougher enemies. MM6 had superior music, although the songs in this weren't bad. Annoyingly the music doesn't loop without reloading a save."
Warframe,1.12.2017,MMORPG,Windows,2013,Other,"Enjoyable fluid 3rd person movement and combat, engaging story, yet it's still a repetitive MMORPG. Could use more variety in level design and maps with wide open areas."
Doki Doki Literature Club,29.10.2017,Visual novel,Windows,2017,Steam,"The sentient-AI / self-aware characters gimmick is done well, although by this point so many games have gone that way that it doesn't deliver much surprises. I'm not a fan of Visual Novels that go for the whole dating sim waifu gimmicks, and as such I wasn't too into the game"
Hollow Knight,1.10.2017,Metroidvania,Windows,2017,GOG,"The best metroidvania I've ever played. The vastness of the game world surprised me several times, making me ask "There's MORE?!" over and over again. The controls were fine, yet I don't understand why the game recommends a controller since there's no analog input of any kind. I found keyboard superior after playing around 75% of the game with a controller. Sometimes pretty tricky, some bosses were boring and some "access" items should have been granted earlier."
Total War Shogun 2 + Fall of the Samurai,1.8.2017,RTS,Windows,2011,Steam,"People say this is the best of the Total War games and I definitely wasn't disappointed. I would have wanted more variety in the units and battlefields, as particularly fort battles got repetitive."
Dishonored 2,1.7.2017,Thief,Windows,2016,Steam,"The game does not deviate much from what Dishonored 1 already established. I got the feeling the developers were afraid to change what had worked in the earlier game and stuck with that. Levels were smaller, but I'd say superior to the first game. Story wasn't as interesting. Unfortunately, massive amounts of crashing ultimately made this a worse game than the first one. The customer support mostly passed my crash reports around with answering my questions, nor did they actually seemingly care about if I offered them any more detailed crash details. Oh well."
Metro 2033 Redux,30.4.2017,FPS,Windows,2010,GOG,"A linear FPS with first person cutscenes and "press E to progress in the game" QTEs. Good atmosphere, functional progression. Horde attack sequences get pretty boring quickly, and sometimes running out of gas mask filters can require a replay of the entire chapter. Interesting moral compass system that's hidden from the player, but makes sense in regards to the story."
Betrayer,17.4.2017,FPS,Windows,2014,Steam,"Impressive atmosphere. Does a fine job in making the player learn the mechanics without explaining them, and to let the player decide what the game is about. The game stops giving new things to do early on and the game gets repetitive. There was one crash, and a few times I got stuck in geometry and had to reload. Writing and art are enjoyable enough. The weapon and item upgrades seemed out of place as they didn't matter except for the very end game items that offered significant bonuses."
Hyper Light Drifter,19.3.2017,Top down shooter,Windows,2016,GOG,"Amazing art, music, atmosphere and good gameplay. There were some issues with the combat, particularly stunlocks being an occasionao annoyment. The movement speed was a bit on the slower side before getting the dash upgrade. The intro cinematic is among the best I've ever seen and it took me a good while to understand that it was an allegory of the lead developer's own life and his maladies. After reading about the problems the lead developer had lived through, the entire game started making sense. Absolutely beautiful."
Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight,8.2.2017,Platformer,Windows,2016,Steam,"Improves on the previous Momodoras in all regards without changing the formula too much. Boss fights were on the easier side and I got the feeling the game was designed with challenge runs / speedruns in mind. Controlled the best out of all the games."
Tex Murhpy Tesla Effect,5.2.2017,FMV,Windows,2014,Steam,"Occasionally filled with the typical Tex Murphy style awful puzzles, the game is a honest sequel to the original Tex games. Quality is generally improved, but there are a ton of tiny papercuts around the game, especially in the environment, that show they didn't have time to finalize the game. Pretty much entirely bug free, saving and loading works well. The whole score system seemed silly. There's really no reason to play the game on Gamer difficulty as there's a ton of pixel hunt puzzles of the modern variety where you need to spot the 3D model that is for some reason interactable when the rest of the scenery isn't. On Casual difficulty these hotpoints are marked and I'd say it's essential for completing the game. Acting's improved a bit, but it's still pretty tongue-in-cheek at times. Plot was typical Tex Murhpy where it gets too complicated and into James Bond territory towards the end. Romancing the transsexual results in the best ending ever."
Dark Souls 3,15.1.2017,Souls,Windows,2016,Steam,"Linear gameplay with no interconnecting areas was a letdown. Bosses were initially extremely difficult due to the transition from Souls 1 & 2 to Bloodborne style boss fights where fast maneuvering is essential. Enemies appeared to be much more intelligent than earlier, but their apparent lack of stamina and huge poise were kind of annoying. There were several gameplay bugs (teleporting enemies for one) that were problematic. Too many bosses were large humanoids with fire attacks, although the game's best boss, Pontiff Sulyvahn, was pretty interesting. Not many of the bosses were that memorable. A shout-out should go the game running relatively well on a lower end PC with low settings. Storyline and the atmosphere was better than Souls 2, but not as interesting as 1."
I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream,10.12.2016,Point & Click,DOS,1995,GOG,"I read the novel before getting into this game, to make sure I had a good foundation on what the game was trying to express. The original short story was, possibly, a take on the cold war and nuclear apocalypse, and the story uses this to paint a picture of hell.\n\nThe game's story was written in collaboration with the orginal author Harlan Ellison (who also provided the voice acting for the AI AM), and the writing is definitely the game's strongest part. Apparently the game's main focus was decided to be the character's back stories and psychological problems when the game's main writer David Sears asked Ellison why AM had selected the five people into its eternal torment. This question surprised Harrison and they then worked out the characters' backstories. The narrative is told in a sequence of 5 independent stories during which the characters come to terms with their own shortcomings. The final chapter is particularly interesting.\n\nThe programming was outsourced to an external company. I have no idea if the product was hurried into release, but the game is a buggy mess. There are glitchy graphics (Benny grows an extra arm during a cutscene), out-of-sequence puzzles being buggy (digging a grave, exiting the screen and returning to the screen removes the grave, but the interactable grave object still exists on the screen), save corruption happens (loading a game in Benny's chapter will cause the character to be invisible and interacting with anything will soft lock the game, although re-saving and loading again will fix this), there's at least one game locking puzzle that can be sequence skipped, object examine texts don't get updated (pick up a key, looking at the thing where the key was will still describe a key being on the table), sometimes cutscenes don't get triggered until the screen is entered a few times... It's a disaster.\n\nThe puzzles are somewhat challenging. Often times the solution to a puzzle is to go back and forth between trying something and then talking to a character to get their updated response to it. In Ellen's chapter you can only pick up a really obvious item near the chapter's end for some reason. The final chapter is extremely difficult, albeit interesting. It should be noted the game has some of the most surprising solutions to puzzles I've seen in a long, long time. Some of it is pretty gross. I'm amazed what they were allowed to leave in the game - who knows what the publisher forced them to remove.\n\nOriginally the author wasn't going to let the developers add in a \'happy\' ending as he didn't want the game to be winnable, but they had to later make some amendmends, supposedly because it would have been bad marketting to advertise a game one cannot win.\n\nMusic was pretty enjoyable. There was enough of it to offer some variety, although there could have been more. It's pretty traditional mid 90s MIDI if that's your thing.\n\nArtwork is mediocre. Animations have room for improvement while backgrounds look alright."
Castlevania,21.11.2016,Platformer,NES,1986,Emulator,"About as bad as primitive NES platformers get"
Super Metroid,20.11.2016,Metroidvania,SNES,1994,Emulator,"Overall, the game was damn good. I found myself rather bored in the last water area, mainly because it seemed to involve a lot of trick jumps to get items. It wasn't as bad as La-Mulana in showing you something you think you need to be able to solve, only to find out you solve that 5 minutes before the game ends. Instead most of the times the thing was achievable pretty soon and every area had parts that were clearly marked "you need an item to get through here." I wasn't a fan of taking damage upon touching enemies, which is also what annoyed me in La-Mulana. The final boss had a weird attack that was seemingly unavoidable and killed you unless you had more than x health. I also didn't really understand what I was fighting there, but maybe if I had the game manual it would tell me\n\nThe progression was pretty fluid. Sometimes I had difficulties remembering what was where as the game doesn't really make any kind of notes. Suppose this was '94.\n\nI also had issues finding my way around as I got lost in the dungeon\n\nAt least the game didn't require you to run all the way to the top using the normal route at the end. That would have taken me 30 minutes.\n\nThe wall jumping was really neat. It was a bit sad how you didn't really need it after getting some items"
Momodora 3,25.9.2016,Platformer,Windows,2014,Steam,"While the previous game offered an illusion of freedom in choosing one's path, this game moves to a linear platformer. The game runs about the same as the second game, but is faster paced. Story does not really exist."
Momodora 2,24.9.2016,Platformer,Windows,2011,Free,"Some controls need improvement. Screen transitions are occasionally awful as enemies you don't see can hit you from outside the screen, or you can walk right into an enemy that's waiting at the screen transition. Difficulty is pretty good, requiring some tries but not too brutal. Enemies deal contact damage which can be annoying when attacking with the main weapon has such a short range. Pretty graphics, enjoyable music. No bugs. Character art reminds me of Touhou character portraits."
Elite Dangerous,1.1.2016,Space flight sim,Windows,2014,Other / Steam,"Really fun for flying around. Looks great. That's about it. It's euro truck in space where you don't have anything to do, and the argument for saying it's a multiplayer game only is valid when the P2P architecture eventually works with more than 2 players robustly."
The Samaritan Paradox,9.8.2016,Point & Click,Windows,2014,GOG,"For a game released in 2014 this title seems extremely dated. It might be that I'm used to more finalized adventure games (namely from Wadjet Eye) and haven't played any of the more basic Adventure Game Studio releases in a while.\n\nThe biggest downside of the game were the bugs. On two occasions I ended up having a bug that required me to reload and earlier save as I was in an unwinnable state. Once the game stopped rendering the graphics after a screen transition during a cutscene, leaving the game screen completely black until I restarted the game. The path-finding has a few quirks, and sometimes the wrong animations played when walking around.\n\nThe story of the game, like in most adventure games, is one of the better aspects. For many adventure titles the story is made too complex and the ending arrives hurried. In this case I felt the story might have been a bit on the simpler side and wasn't deep or long enough.\n\nThe characters were enjoyable enough, the protagonist being my favorite. Voice acting was passable, but a few characters had voices that were simply bad.\n\nPuzzles were refreshing difficult - even too much so. It's rare, but in this case I had to resort to a walkthrough to finish the game. A few of the puzzles required some knowledge that to my understanding cannot be found inside the game world. A die-hard adventure game player will probably solve all the puzzles with determination, though.\n\nMusic was good.\n"
Audioshield,27.8.2016,VR arcade,Windows,2016,Steam,"Audiosurf for VR. Tron style graphics work well, and the ability to use own music gives the game a lot of replayablity. The mechanics are a bit too simple, and mods are required to make it more interesting. Reasonable fun, but the price tag of 20 dollars is too high."
Cat Lady,24.7.2016,Psychological horror / adventure,Windows,2012,GOG,"This game is probably the one that best explores depression, with Depression Quest coming close second. Although the beginning of the game has some writing in it that was in my opinion lacking, overall the story is enjoyable after the beginning.\nThe graphics style was interesting. It should be noted that I didn't like the first game, Downfall especially due to its writing and graphics, but in this one both parts worked better.\nAudio has issues. The voice actors are passable, but unfortunately the recording equipment or mastering wasn't done with the highest quality in mind and occasionally even regular speech ends up breaking.\n\nPuzzles were mostly alright, although a few of them felt like they didn't belong there."
Her Story,11.8.2016,FMV,Windows,2015,GOG,"Goes for the whole Memento thing where the story is not told in a linear fashion. This allows the player to piece the puzzle together from the perspective of the detective. It was pretty fun to write down notes and slowly uncover the truth. I found it quite difficult to find the missing pieces in the storyline as I couldn't figure out the right keyword to use and the video listing only allowed 5 videos. I ended up going through the video files in the game folder manually. The game's only mechanic is the video archive system, stylished as it may be, but unfortunately it's not worth the game's price."
Technobabylon,11.6.2016,Point & Click,Windows,2015,GOG,"Lost the review when the forums went down. TL;DR: A contender for the best point & click game ever game, up there with the likes of the Longest Journey and Unavowed. Play it."
Shardlight,11.3.2016,Point & Click,Windows,2016,GOG,"Lost the review when the forums went down. A solid point & click adventure that has its highs and lows, but overall is still a bargain for the price they're asking. Play it."
SOMA,1.8.2016,Walking simulator,Windows,2015,GOG,"Looks beautiful, writing is enjoyable, world fascinating. Monster segments were the worst portions - maybe installing that mod that disables mob aggression would have been a good idea. Those kinda broke the flow of the game. The big part that really sold the game to me was that there weren't any plot twists - everything is revealed in the beginning and the rest of the journey is simply exploring that topic."
Gray Matter,1.7.2016,Point & Click,Windows,2011,GOG,"Among the list of best systems for puzzles ever done in a video game, this game scores pretty high. The old "use item y on x" gimmick is still there, but the main showdown is the repertoire of magic tricks the protagonist can pull in order to con others. My biggest beef with this was that there wasn't enough of using magic tricks - surely they could have replaced some of the more traditional puzzles with a few additional sleights of hand.\n\nMost of the game is doing detective work of sorts and solving riddles, driving two plotlines forwards. The story itself is curious enough, although nothing too unique.\n\nIt baffles me how a point & click adventure game where the backgrounds are largely still image mattes can end up having a loading screen between each screen transition. Sometimes these loading times were up to 10 seconds on a reasonably powerful computer. Perhaps the game was designed so it worked on mobile platforms or something and always loaded the background images from disk or something along those lines. Anyway, whatever the reason was, the loading times were a definite problem.\n\nAnimations were occasionally dreadfully slow. Luckily, the game allows fast travelling using the map and skipping moving to the room's exit by double clicking.\n\nThe music in the game was alright and did its task well in the background. The primary letdown was that there wasn't enough music: With the exception of a couple cutscenes, the single, same music track with a pleasant piano melody is heard during the entire game. It got pretty repetitive towards the latter portions.\n\nVoice acting was alright. There was some room for improvement, though."
Last Express,1.6.2016,Point & Click,DOSBox,1997,GOG,"I have never played a game quite like this. Beyond its rough edges there exists a gem that is among the most immersive games I've played. The game produces an illusion of \'Choose Your Own Adventure\' due to the world acting without the player's presence. The player can be at the opposite end of the train, and events, even if scripted, are taking place, whether or not the player is there to see them.\n\nThe game is railroaded in the way that when bad ends happen the game offers a clock which the player can roll back to re-live past events. This happens until the player finally manages to solve all the puzzles in the right order and reach the true end.\n\nVoice acting is fantastic. I don't speak any of the foreign languages, but it definitely sounded natural when I heard Serbians talking among themselves, the upper class French chatting with the Germans and the Austrian doing her best to speak English.\n\nPuzzles are minimal, and very easy. The game is mostly about doing things in the right order and later correcting your mistakes.\n\nA must play."

Dark Souls,1.1.2015,Souls,Windows,2009,Steam,"The game's ability to transform players is quite something. At the beginning of the journey the game slaps the player on their wrists, punishing the player for their every mistake. At several tiers of graduation examination the game slowly trains the player into understanding the game. After a specific boss fight the player will have leveled up more from that encounter than his character has. This game has, in my opinion, the best boss fight in the history of video gaming (O&S).\n\nThe level design and atmosphere are the game's strongest point. Everything connects logically and with style. There are no hub areas or nonsensical locations, but only the ruins of a fallen world now occupied by the undead and worse. What really separates this game from a lot of similar games is how it accomplishes its strongest point, the atmosphere.\n\nWith most games people generally play the game once, and if they really liked the game they will give it a second go. On a rare occasion people will keep playing the game over and over again. With Dark Souls I don't know a single person who has completed the game and left it there - they all come back for the game's massive replay value.\n\nThe game's biggest issues relate to its console origins: Framerate is defaulted to 30, and using mods to increase it to 60 will cause physics bugs. The online play is glitchy as best and lag has a constant presence.\n\nSeveral points in the game are too difficult unless you already have mastered a Souls game earlier. Many people will quit the game at these points for understandable reasons."

The only downside in this game, I think, is that it doesn't have any replay value. After you've rammed your head against the wall for 10 months you already know the solutions to all the puzzles and there's not much to experience in it. I didn't find the combat that interesting that I'd want to try the game again for more combat challenge. Incredible music."
